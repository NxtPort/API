## Purpose of this API

The 'Arrival at Exit API' unburdens the terminal operator to send each Arrival at Exit of an export container to Customs. With the 'Arrival at Exit API' you get a ready to send Charge Report for Customs. Terminal operators only have to share their 'gate in full' moves on the NxtPort-platform and we will map this to the requested Charge Report format. As a terminal operator you always will be able to keep track if the Charge Report message is accepted/rejected by Customs Authorities.
