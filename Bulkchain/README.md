# Bulkchain 
```
 This documentation applies to v1.0 of the API. The API is in pilot and under constant development so updates will be applied.
```
# Purpose of the API

The Bulkchain initiative was launched on request by the breakbulk community in order to digitise the existing administrative collaborative processes.  
  
By sharing data during import, export, storage and CFS processes, the different stakeholders that work together to ship breakbulk cargo around the globe, can interact with each other with secured and organised guidelines. 
This allows them to jointly build-up orders, track the status of commercial and custom releases or be notified when critical information is missing to meet closings or deadlines.

We advise all involved parties to [read the introduction](https://nxtport.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BREAK/pages/1353351170/Introduction+to+Bulkchain) to Bulkchain on our Wiki.
