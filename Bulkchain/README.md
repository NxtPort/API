# Bulkchain - Export
```
 This documentation applies to v0.1 of the API. It is still under development so updates will be applied.

# Purpose of the API

The Bulkchain initiative was launched on request by the breakbulk community in order to digitise the existing administrative collaborative processes.  
  
By sharing data during import, export, storage and CFS processes, the different stakeholders that work together to ship breakbulk cargo around the globe, can interact with each other with secured and organised guidelines. 
This allows them to jointly build-up orders, track the status of commercial and custom releases or be notified when critical information is missing to meet closings or deadlines.

We currently support the following supply chain roles within the Proof of Concept:

 - Forwarders
 - Liner/Shipping agents
 - Terminals

The following roles will be added over the coming months. 
 - Customs
 - Port Authorities
 - Shipper/Consignor
 - Receiver/Consignee
 - Transport company (truck/rail/barge/coaster)

Interested companies can already join the initiative by contacting us.
