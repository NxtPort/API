# Join the proof of concept!
The Bulkchain Export API is currently under development. Our objective is to get an MVP ready by the end of Q2 2019. In the meanwhile, NxtPort will be releasing  parts of the solution as separate Proof of Concepts. Companies, developers and enthousiasts are free to join the initiative. 

If you want to join, please send an email to [Steven Schutter](mailto:steven.schutter@nxtport) and we will do the necessary to give you access.

# Functionality
The preview/proof of concept is running in our staging environment. This allows subscribed entities to make API calls and login onto the web portal. The provided accounts might be shared so it is possible that you can see objects created by others and that others can edit objects that you create.

# Requirements
When contacting us to join the Proof of Concept, we will provide you with
* an API key, allowing your API calls to be authenticated
* client parameters for access tokens that you need in the API calls
* the API endpoint for send the requests
* the login endpoint, allowing you to retrieve access tokens
* the portal url to open and monitor the orders
* a swagger file: you can enter this file in a swagger parser (for instance the one from [swagger.io](http://editor.swagger.io/)) so you can see the interface of the API in a form that allows you to make some calls

# What we expect from you
If you sign up for a preview we expect that
* you do not link the data for live processes: the connection details and the data that come from the api are for preview purposes and will be treated as such. Data will be cleared every month during the preview.
* you provide feedback: please tell us if we're heading in the right direction or not. Use [our contact form](https://nxtport.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/4) to get in touch.
