# Certified Pick up
```
 This documentation applies to v1.0 of the API. 
```

# Purpose of the API
The Certified Pick up solution consists of multiple APIâ€™s which provide a secure container pick-up at the terminal.
This will be achieved by obtaining release information of the different stakeholders (Ship Agents, Terminals, Forwarders, Transporters,...), until the identity of the driver that will vouch for the actual pick-up at the terminal is known. When all the responsible parties (e.g. Terminals, Ship Agent,...) have given their approval, the assigned driver will be enabled to pick the container up.

We advise all involved parties to [read the welcome pack]( https://www.nxtport.com/documentation/certified-pick-up).
