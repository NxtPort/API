# Next Mode of Transport

## About

By announcing the NMoT to the terminal, stacking of containers on the yard can be optimized for hinterland pickup. This can significantly shorten the turnaround time for trucks, barges and trains at the terminal , as the containers are readily available (no more 'digging out') at the correct location (trucking gate, water side, rail side).

## Format

NMoT visits and exchanges can be sent in three formats:

* The standard NxtPort preannouncement document in XML or JSON. See the [test form for the API](https://nxtport.github.io/?api=nmot) for the structure and a generated example.
* A more consice [alternative in CSV format](csv.md) and specific for NMoT.
