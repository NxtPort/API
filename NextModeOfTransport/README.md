# Next Mode of Transport Notification Service API

Announce the NMoT of your container to the terminal

| This documentation applies to v1.0 of this API | 
| -------- |


## Purpose of this API

By announcing the NMoT to the terminal, stacking of containers on the yard can be optimized for hinterland pickup. This can significantly shorten the turnaround time for trucks, barges and trains at the terminal , as the containers are readily available (no more 'digging out') at the correct location (trucking gate, water side, rail side).
