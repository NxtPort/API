# POA EDI To XML Convertor API

| This documentation applies to v1.0 of this API |
| -------- |


## Purpose of this API

Port of Antwerp requires that connected parties provide COARRI and CODECO messages to support certain business processes. These messages must be submitted in the “D95B EDI XML Variant 2” format. Certain parties handle a different format of these messages. By sending in the messages through the foreseen NxtPort endpoints, NxtPort is able to transform them into the desired format and deliver them to Port of Antwerp.
