# POAB EDI To XML Convertor API

| This documentation applies to v1.0 of this API |
| -------- |


## Purpose of this API

Port of Antwerp-Bruges requires that connected parties provide COARRI and CODECO messages to support dangerous goods business processes. Parties unable to provide data directly to POAB in "D95B EDI XML Variant 2" format, can submit them to this API in "D95B EDI" format. NxtPort will transform these files into the desired format and deliver them to Port of Antwerp-Bruges.
