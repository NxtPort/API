## Purpose of this API

**Port+** combines data from different sources in one database to build one dataset of vessels with their relevant stay information.

With this API you are able to get a realtime overview of all the expected and in port vessels for the ports of Antwerp and Zeebrugge. When a vessel is expected the known IN vessel will be returned. When a vessel is in-port the active voyage of that time will be returned.
