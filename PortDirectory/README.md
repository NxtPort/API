## Purpose of this API

**Port+** keeps a detailed contact list of companies that are active in the Belgian and Zeeland ports: the **Portdirectory**. Through an online portal you can look for a company based on the port where it is active, its types of services, accessibilities, etc ... 

The portal provides useful information like contact details, activities, management info, opening hours, etc. The listed companies can check and update their info through a personal & secure URL. Every year, the Portdirectory is published in the form of a book. 

The NxtPort platform now offers the Portdirectory as an API as well, so that you can reuse the information in your applications.
