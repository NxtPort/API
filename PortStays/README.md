| -------- |


## Purpose of this API

APICS makes two Open Data APIs available through the NxtPort platform: PortStays and PortVoyages.

The PortStays API contains a summary overview of all sea-going vessels that are expected to be in Antwerp, are sailing up, are in the port or have sailed for the past 24 hours. 
The API is made available through the NxtPort API marketplace. 
Companies that want to use the API are required to register with NxtPort. Use of the API is free but limited to 100 queries per day per company. 
This offers customers of the API the possibility to request an update every 15 minutes.
Companies can get an update of all changes with 1 API call since a certain moment.
This moment can be up to 6 hours earlier than the time of the API call.
