# Endpoints

This API comes in two *editions* or flavours:


| Edition | URL | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| sandbox | https://api-sb.nxtport.eu/blockchain/ | The sandbox is an environment identical to the live environment, but with dummy data. The aim is to provide a safe and free environment to develop and test applications, before using them on live data. |
| live | https://api.nxtport.eu/blockchain/ | The live environment works with real production data. |
 
Please note that the sandbox and live editions are **separate in the NxtPort Market** and you will need a subscription for each of these if you want to use both.
