# UN/LOCODE API

Easy use of the UN/LOCODE dataset in your applications.

## Purpose of this API

To meet the growing need for an international and efficient location naming convention, the UN have put in place the **United Nations LOCODE (UN/LOCODE)**. This code system is intended to cover ports, airports and other locations frequently used for goods movements in international trade.

The codes are based on entries from governments and international organizations, or users requests. UN/LOCODE is continuously maintained and is made available on the UN website as a dataset (that can be consulted or downloaded). An updated list is made available twice per year.

Not having this information available in an API means that many companies and organizations use their own location codes instead of the standardized UN codes. NxtPort is now offering the UN/LOCODE data in a user-friendly API format. No more need for you to download, integrate and update the dataset into your application. When you call the API, you automatically get the correct information.

The UN/LOCODE API allows you to:

* Get location details based on a location code
* Search for locations based on simple search parameters
* Search for locations near a point on a map

NxtPort keeps the API up-to-date with the latest UN dataset. Any requests for additional services or for locations to be added to the API can be discussed with NxtPort.
