# API Operations

## Countries & subdivisions
ISO 3166 is the international standard for country codes and codes for their subdivisions (states, provinces â€¦). Names are defined by UN sources. Operations in the API are included to request a complete list of countries and its subdivision or get the details of 1 specific country or subdivision.
## Locations

The API offers 3 operations that focus on locations (that have UN locodes). All these operations will return the information of the included locations in a more user-friendly format.* Get the details of a location based on its 5-character locode (2-character country code + 3-character code)
* Search for locations based on a few search filters, including:
	* 	2-character country code 
	*  	3-character subdivision code
	*  3-character code
	*  searchterm: a part of the location name without diacritics
	*  page & pagesize (to support paging)
*  Search for locations in a certain area: by specifying a specific point (longitude+latitude combination) and a radius (in km), the API will search for locations within the specified radius of that point.
