This API comes in two *editions* or flavours:

| Edition | URL | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| sandbox | https://api-sb.nxtport.eu/VGM/v1/ | provides predictable responses based on sample data |
| live | https://api.nxtport.eu/VGM/v1/ | returns actual consignment info from operational VERMAS input |

Please note that the sandbox and live editions are **separate in the NxtPort Market** and you will need a subscription for each of these if you want to use both.
  
The interface and authentication requirements for both editions are **identical**.
